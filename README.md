## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code installed on your machine.
- **Apache Tomcat** server installed and configured on your system.
- A Spring MVC project ready to run.
- Node.js and Angular CLI installed to build the UI part.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

### Running the Extension in Developer Mode
Since the extension is **not yet available on the marketplace**, you can run it in **developer mode** after cloning the repository:

1. **Build the UI**:
   - Navigate to the `UI` directory within the project.
   - Run `ng build` to build the Angular UI.

2. **Open in Developer Mode**:
   - After building the UI, open the root project folder in VS Code.
   - Press `F5` to open the extension in **developer mode**.

### Usage
1. **Open the Tomcat Runner Extension**:
   - Once installed, open the **Tomcat Runner** extension by clicking on its icon in the Activity Bar or searching for "Tomcat Runner" in the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).

2. **Configure Your Tomcat Server**:
   - When you open the extension, you will be prompted to **select a configuration**. There can be multiple configurations if you have more than one Tomcat server or project.
   - **Configuration Name**: Choose the configuration from the list (e.g., `Tomcat-8080`, `Tomcat-9090`).
   - **Port Number**: Specify the port on which the Tomcat server will run (e.g., `8080`).
   - **Admin Port**: Specify the admin port if required (e.g., `8005`).
   - **Context Path**: Set the context path for your project (e.g., `/myapp`).
   - **Tomcat Server Directory**: Provide the path to your **Tomcat installation directory** (e.g., `/path/to/tomcat`).

3. **Run the Project**:
   - After configuring, click **Run** to start the Tomcat server with your specified settings.
   - The project will be deployed to the specified Tomcat server and will be accessible via the browser at the configured port and context path (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/myapp`).

4. **Debugging**:
   - To debug, simply select the **Debug** option from the command palette or in the extension interface.
   - Tomcat Runner will launch the server with debugging support enabled, allowing you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and debug your Spring MVC application directly within VS Code.

5. **View Logs**:
   - During runtime, Tomcat Runner will display **live logs** in the **VS Code Output Panel**.
   - This makes it easy to monitor the application‚Äôs performance, errors, and system messages directly within the editor.
